Our ministry leaders can initiate the background checks themselves.  All these checks route to a single person and 
this report is to help provide a single painted glass view of the last 30 days of checks.

Pain points we still have:  
- Do not know what ministry requested the check
- System does not have checks/balances of preventing a background check on somebody that is within the limits.
- No reminders to requestor on background check
- Cannot delete an old background check
- If you set a background check to "not approved" it still will allow the end user to complete a background check
