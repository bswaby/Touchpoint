### 📅 [Anniversaries](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/Anniversaries)
It is designed as a widget on your dashboard that tracks member anniversaries, such as marriage, work, and birthdays.  We use it to track staff anniversaries, but it could easily be used for any group as it's based on a saved search.

- ⚙️ **Implementation Level: Moderate
- 🧩 **Installation: Weddings and birthdays are tracked naturally in the system and uses a "saved search" to pull the list from. Extra anniversaries are tracked using an extra value field under a user's profile, but are not required.  To install, you first create a saved search in Touchpoint and then write down the name of it.  Then, paste the code, set the parameters, add the word widget to content keywords, and save it.  From there, you need to go into Admin ~ Advanced ~ HomePage widget and add this as a widget to have it appear on the homepage.
