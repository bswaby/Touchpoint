This has helped us further understand who is sending messages out, find issues with SMS, and allowed us to work through some strategic communication methods, such as parents getting multiple emails from various age-grade pastors covering similar subjects.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Easy
- üß© **Installation: This is a paste-and-go Python script with no configuration needed.
