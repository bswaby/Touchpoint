### 💰 Involvements with Fees Report

  A finance tool that automatically identifies and reports on all TouchPoint involvements that have
  associated fees. It supports both legacy XML fee storage and the new JSON registration system, saving finance teams hours of manual
  searching and reconciliation work.

  ⚙️ Implementation Level: Easy-Moderate
  🧩 Installation: This script requires the Finance role and is ready to use out of the box. Simply upload the script and optionally add it to your menu. The tool automatically detects your TouchPoint configuration and adapts to both old XML and new JSON fee formats.

  🎯 Key Features:

  - KPI Cards: Total involvements, total fees collected, registration counts, and average fee per involvement
  - Creator Analytics: See who's creating fee-based involvements and their total impact
  - Date Range Filtering: Default 30-day view with customizable date ranges
