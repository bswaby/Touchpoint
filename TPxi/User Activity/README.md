### üó∫Ô∏è [User Activity](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/User%20Activity)
This is to help get an idea of user activity levels based on the activity log table.   You can even search a single person with this and see how much they worked at the church, home, mobile and an estimated amount of time they worked in the system.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Easy
- üß© **Installation: This is a paste-and-go Python script with only one configuration option that you might want to consider: OFFICE_IP_ADDRESSES configuration option determines if people are working in the office or outside the office if you configure it with your network ip addresses.
