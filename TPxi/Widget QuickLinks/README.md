### ‚ö° [Widget QuickLinks](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/Widget%20QuickLinks)
This provides quick-access links for users to get to things quickly.  The links are permission-based and only show links if they have permission to it.  You can categorize your links into groups to help give focus to the link types.  Lastly, there is an advanced feature to add a count on top of the icon to give some level of need for the link.   

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Moderate-Advanced
- üß© **Installation: While the overall implementation is not overly complicated, using the count overlay and understanding how some of the configuration parameters go in can take moderate to advanced knowledge.

<p>The tool implementation is intermediate level, but not overly difficult</p>
