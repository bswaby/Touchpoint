### ‚Üª [Involvement Sync](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/Involvement%20Sync)
This provides an easy method to sync a primary involvement to a secondary. It can be used in cases where scheduler involvement doesn't allow non-scheduled people to check in or to keep two involvements synced, in which they need slightly different print settings. For example, our worship team needs badges on all days except Sunday, and remembering to turn off badge printing keeps getting forgotten.  

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Easy
- üß© **Installation: This is a paste-and-go Python script, with the only configuration needed to schedule it to run.
