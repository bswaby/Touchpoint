This analytical dashboard provides insights into membership trends, retention patterns, and demographic shifts across multiple periods. This report helps see growth patterns, opportunities, and potential concerns before they become problems. What previously required exporting data to Excel and hours of manual analysis now generates instantly with interactive visualizations and drill-down capabilities. The only note is that our cohort retention analysis is not helpful yet, as we only have 2 years of data coming over to Touchpoint.
