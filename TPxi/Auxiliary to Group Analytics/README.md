### üìä [Auxiliary to Group Analytics](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/blob/main/TPxi/Auxiliary%20to%20Group%20Analytics/TPxi_Auxiliary2Group.py)
The Auxiliary to Group Analytics dashboard helps churches analyze how effectively their various programs drive attendance to Groups. It tracks actual attendance patterns, identifies true conversions (people who joined Connect Groups AFTER participating in programs), and provides summary and detailed metrics to measure program success in building ongoing community connections.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Level: Easy
- üß© **Installation: Minimal configuration required. Edit the CHURCH_PROGRAM_ID (your Group program ID) and update the PROGRAM_IDS dictionary with your specific programs to analyze. The tool uses actual attendance data from the Attend table to ensure accurate metrics.
