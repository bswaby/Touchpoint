### üöó [FastLaneCheckIn](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/FastLaneCheckIn)
This streamlined check-in interface is designed for large events (100‚Äì2500+ attendees). The core goals are:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Be fast for large crowds
2Ô∏è‚É£ Always work towards <b>zero</b>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Communicate clearly with both staff and attendees.

The app is intentionally minimal and is optimized for use by individuals or teams handling alphabetically segmented lines (A‚ÄìF, G‚ÄìL, etc). Users can select one or more Involvements with an active meeting for the day.

2Ô∏è‚É£ üÜï Recent Updates
- 6/5/2025: Added Email Notification feature. When a person checks in:
  - If 18+, an email is sent directly to them.
  - If under 18, an email is sent to their parent/guardian.
  - Uses existing system email templates (must include CheckedIn in the name).
- 6/7/2025:
  - Feature 1: Ability to show specific Groups during check-in (e.g. Bus assignments, Cabin groups, Subgroups). Useful for quick communication.
  - Feature 2: Added an Outstanding Payment flag during check-in to clearly indicate unpaid balances.
  - Feature 3: Added alphabet grouping options in the UI so it no longer needs to be a configuration change.

Note: This will <b>not</b> print badges, as those modules from TP are not exposed.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Easy
