### ‚úÖ [Weekly Attendance](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/Weekly%20Attendance)
This report is still being built, but it is Week at a Glance (WAAG) 2.0 for at least us. The most significant changes are that it compares previous periods and introduces new concepts for tracking metrics with various comparisons.  One of the concepts for WAAG 2.0 is enrollment vs attendance metrics for our connect groups (Sunday School).  This allows us to track the need for outreach or inreach for each ministry area.  Another one is tracking total attendance for either the configured fiscal year or calendar year to the previous period, which helps determine as a whole if you are are up/down.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Easy-Moderate
- üß© **Installation: Most items of this script works, but is still being developed and might contain a few bugs.  Installation is fairly easy, but with the amount of options it can make it seem overwhelming.
