# Giving Dashboard

This was an exhausting but enjoyable project that significantly improved how we display, manage, and share weekly budget amounts.   For our team here, they can;

- Manage the expected budget
- See YoY and WoW Comparisons
- Look for outliers of large gifts
- Select between years
- Run a weekly giving report that can have a custom message when sent externally for your stewardship teams
- Have a series of other financial reports, including opportunities to minister to for those that have lapsed

## Giving Dashboard

### Dashboard and Report
Easy to see how the giving is compared to the budget, along with large gift monitoring for outliers.

### Manage Budget
A budget manager that allows the team to manage the expected budget for the year, including the ability to create special overlap weeks for fiscal/year-end scenarios.
