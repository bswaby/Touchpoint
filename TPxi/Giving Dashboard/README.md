# 💰 Giving Dashboard

This was an exhausting but rewarding project that greatly improved how we display, manage, and share weekly budget information.
It brings clarity, flexibility, and insight to financial stewardship within the organization.

With this dashboard, our team can:

- Manage the expected budget and track real-time progress
- Compare Year-over-Year (YoY) and Week-over-Week (WoW) giving trends
- Identify outliers such as unusually large gifts for review or celebration
- Select between years to view historical giving data
- Run weekly giving reports, complete with a custom message for stewardship teams when sent externally
- Access a suite of financial reports, including tools to identify lapsed givers and potential ministry opportunities
