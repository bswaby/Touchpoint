### üí≥ [Deposit Report]
Comprehensive deposit tracking and reconciliation tool for ministry finances. This report streamlines the deposit preparation by automatically categorizing payments by type (cash, check, credit card) and fund, providing daily breakdowns with expandable transaction details, and generating deposit slips for the finance team reconciliation.

  - ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Level: Easy
  - üß© **Installation: This is a paste-and-go Python script with minimal configuration needed (verify payment type IDs match your TouchPoint setup).

<i><b>Note:</b>  Touchpoint does not give options to mark cash and checks in their system.  To get around this, we use a CSH/CHK prefix, thus allowing the report to reduce the overhead of deposit reports.  To help ensure CHK/CSH gets added to the description, it's recommended to use Payment Manager to intake payments as it adds the appropriate prefix along with sending the payer an actual receipt for their transaction.</i>
