### üìä [Weekly Contribution Report](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/Contribution%20Report)
Our finance team uses this primary tool to track, report, and work through finances each week.  By using the system as their process and reporting mechanism, they have helped ensure the system is right to move forward and remove some of the hocus pocus potential of changing numbers outside the system. One of the pleasant surprises for us is that it revealed some newer features in Touchpoint that we were not taking advantage of.  This helped us to start to take advantage of those and further organize/define our financial data.  

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Easy
