# Involvement Processor

A comprehensive involvement management tool built for TouchPoint that streamlines the process of reviewing registrants, assigning them to target involvements, and tracking work across sessions.

With this tool, our team can:

- Search and filter involvements by name, ID, program, or division
- View registrants with their registration question responses
- Apply advanced filters by gender, age, subgroups, and question answers
- Bulk-assign selected people to target involvements and subgroups in one action
- Track which registrants have been processed with visual status indicators
- Save and load named work sessions (Efforts) to pick up where you left off
- Maintain watchlists for tracking specific people across involvements
- Save setup configurations for quick recall on recurring tasks

## Setup Panel

Search for a source involvement, filter by program or division, and select which registration questions to display. Manage saved efforts to organize your work into named sessions.


## Registrants Panel

View all registrants from the selected involvement with their registration question responses. Filter by name, gender, age, subgroups, or question answers. Processed registrants are visually marked with a green indicator.


## Selection Queue & Target Assignment

Select registrants into a queue, then assign them in bulk to a target involvement and subgroups. The queue stays visible as you scroll through registrants.


## Effort Management

Save your work as named efforts that preserve your source involvement, selected people, target assignments, and processing state. Switch between efforts or pick up where you left off.


## Watchlist (Future Q1 2026)

Add people to a watchlist for tracking across involvements. Assign watchers and manage requests for specific individuals.
