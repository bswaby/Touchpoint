### üó∫Ô∏è [Geographic Distribution Map](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/TPxi/Geographic%20Distribution%20Map)
This blue toolbar visualizes the geographic spread of members or activities in Google Maps. It is similar to Touchpoint's map tool but has three advantages over Touchpoint. 

Advantages
1. You can overlay demographic data from the US Census.
2. You can click on the image to get info on the person, similar to how James Kurtz is doing it.
3. You can draw around a city, neighborhood, etc., and tag or export those people for the selected area

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Level: Easy-Moderate
- üß© **Installation: This is an easy script to implement. The most complicated parts are getting Google Maps and Census API keys.
