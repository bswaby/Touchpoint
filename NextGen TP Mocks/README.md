## 👥 Member Experience

### Member Login
One of the biggest issues today is that everything feels buried — there’s no clear path forward or nudge toward the next step.  
This design focuses on clarity, simplicity, and purpose.

- **Navigation** – Simple and intuitive with minimal clicks in mind  
- **My Family** – Small alerts and encouragements to get connected, serve, learn, and go on mission  
- **For Your Family** – Personalized prompts based on family data and activity  
- **Recent Message** – Provides a clean, consolidated view of the latest sermon or message  
- **Family Calendar** – Central place to view your family’s full schedule

## 🧭 Leader Experience

### Leader Login
Leaders need quick insights and actionable items to encourage and invest in others — and to be alerted when patterns change that may represent a ministry opportunity.  
This dashboard provides a launching point to see everything happening within your sphere of ministry.

- **Navigation** – Consistent layout to easily switch between member and leader views  
- **Ministry Overview** – Quick stats and summaries for those under your leadership  
- **My Teams** – Overview of groups you lead, with engagement and attendance insights  
- **Action Items** – One-click tools to log follow-ups or pastoral efforts  
- **Team Members** – Quick access to individual patterns and activity trends  
- **Recent Activity** – Running list of changes and updates  
- **Quick Launch** – Right toolbar for launching meetings, communications, and tasks  
  - In mobile view, this appears as a floating “+” button in the bottom-right corner
