## 🏛️ [Next Generation Touchpoint Mocks]
These are mock idea I have for what the next generation of Touchpoint should be.

### 🏛️ [Member and Leader]
<summary><strong>Member Login</strong></summary>
<p>One of the biggest issues is that everything is buried, nothing leads you to where you are going, and there is not a nag to push you to the next step.</p>
<ul>
  <li>**Navigation** | Simple with Minimimal Click in Mind</li>
  <li>**My Family** | Small alerts to encouragements to get connected, serve, learn, and go on mission</li>
  <li>**For Your Family** | Based on family and encourages other activities</li>
  <li>**Recent Message** | Provides simple consolidated view</li>
  <li>**Family Calendar** | Central location to see family schedule</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>Leader Login</strong></summary>
<p>As a leader, you need insights and actionable items to encourage, pour into others, and be flagged on pattern changes as those could be a ministry opportunity.  This dashboard provides a launching point to view all that is happening.</p>
<ul>
  <li>**Navigation** | Consistent to easily switch between leader and member</li>
  <li>**Ministry Overview** | Quick stats to show those leader is over</li>
  <li>**My Teams** | Area leader is over with stats on how group(s) are doing</li>
  <li>**Action Items** | Quick action items that log efforts with just a click of a button</li>
  <li>**Team Members** | Get to patterns of those that you lead</li>
  <li>**Recent Activity** | Just a running list of changes</li>
  <li>**Quick Launch** | Right toolbar to quickly launch everything from meetings, communications, to tasks.  In mobile view this would be a floating + on the bottom right.</li>
</ul>
