Simple report that I made for our TP admin to run during the week to see login issues 
and use as a method to follow-up with church members.  

Report has 3 sections
Section 1: Failed Login Counts
  Helps with determine how many times a failure has happened
Section 2: Last 200 failed attempts
  Helps follow the flow of the failures.. Useful if you are activity working with somebody
Section 3: Last 50 Logins
  Show the last 50 successful logins.
  
In addition to the 3 sections, this report runs James @ Tenth Pres User Account Info script, which you can find here.


Setup:  Add User Login Activity.py as a new Python script.  Script should run naturally
