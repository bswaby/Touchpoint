# Church Dashboard Suite

A collection of tools and dashboards designed to support church operations, communication, and data analysis for Touchpoint


## Overview

This repository is the work of one guy who loves Jesus, loves clean data, and loves seeing people come to Christ — so I built a bunch of tools to help make ministry smoother, simpler, and Spirit-led.

## TPxi Modules

### 📅 TPxi Anniversaries
It is designed to be a widget on your dashboard that tracks member anniversaries (marriage, work, and birthdays, primarily, but it can be expanded as well).

### 🔗 TPxi Attachment Link Generator
A tool to make it easier to download documents uploaded to an Involvement

### 📊 TPxi Communication Dashboard
Centralized dashboard for viewing and analyzing communications.

### 📈 TPxi Data Quality Dashboard
Monitors the completeness of database demographics.

### 🚗 TPxi FastLaneCheckIn
This is a streamlined check-in interface for large events. It is made for a person to hold their phone/iPad/tablet to get people checked in quickly. Note:  this doesn't print as those modules are not exposed for use.

### 🗺️ TPxi Geographic Distribution Map
This is a blue toolbar that visualizes the geographic spread of members or activities. It has two advantages over Touchpoint. First, you can overlay demographic data from the census. Second, you can draw around a section of location and tag it to the blue toolbar or export to CSV.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 TPxi Involvement Activity Dashboard
It tracks involvement activity, and it's like Kenny Rogers in that it helps you know when to hold them and when to fold them.

### 🏛️ TPxi Ministry Structure
Displays the hierarchy of program, division, organization, and organization type.

### 📤 TPxi Registration Export
Exports event or class registration data in structured formats.

### 📝 TPxi TaskNote Activity Dashboard
Dashboard to start to understand TaskNote activity, who has open assignment, keyword trends, and more.

### ✅ TPxi Weekly Attendance
This builds on Week at a Glance (WAAG) but introduces many new concepts for tracking metrics with various comparisons.  

### ⚡ TPxi Widget QuickLinks
Quick-access widgets for frequently used tools and dashboards.  These have permission, counts, and categories for displaying access links.
