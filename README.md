# Church Dashboard Suite

A collection of tools and dashboards designed to support church operations, communication, and data analysis for Touchpoint


## Overview

This repository is the work of one guy who loves Jesus, loves clean data, and loves seeing people come to Christ — so I built a bunch of tools to help make ministry smoother, more informed, reduce overhead, and help reach others.

## Finance Modules

### FortisFees (Finance/FortisFees)
It breaks down fees by program and accounting code so accounting can use it to back charge. The biggest note is that the fees will be close to 99% but not 100% due to the disconnect of certain charges and reversals getting back to Touchpoint.  

### QCD-GrandLetters (Finanice/QCD-GrantLetters)
Automatically create QCD and Grant letters that you can print out and add to each person's notes.

### Weekly Contribution Report (Finance/Weekly Contribution Report)
This is the primary tool our finance team tracks, reports, and works through finances each week.

## Reports

### 📊 TPxi Communication Dashboard (TPxi/Communication Dashboard)
Centralized dashboard for viewing and analyzing communications.

### 📈 TPxi Data Quality Dashboard (TPxi/Data Quality Dashboard)
Monitors the completeness of database demographics.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 TPxi Involvement Activity Dashboard
It's like Kenny Rogers in that it helps you know "when to hold them" and "when to fold them" when it comes to your Involvements.

### 🏛️ TPxi Ministry Structure
Displays the hierarchy of program, division, organization, and organization type.

### 📤 TPxi Registration Export
Exports event or class registration data in structured formats.

### 📝 TPxi TaskNote Activity Dashboard
Dashboard to start to understand TaskNote activity, who has open assignments, keyword trends, and more.

### ✅ TPxi Weekly Attendance
This builds on Week at a Glance (WAAG) but introduces many new concepts for tracking metrics with various comparisons.  

## Tools

### 🔗 TPxi Attachment Link Generator
A tool to make it easier to download documents uploaded to an Involvement

### 📅 TPxi Anniversaries
It is designed to be a widget on your dashboard that tracks member anniversaries (marriage, work, and birthdays, primarily, but it can be expanded as well).

### 🚗 TPxi FastLaneCheckIn
This is a streamlined check-in interface for large events. It is made for a person to hold their phone/iPad/tablet to get people checked in quickly. Note:  this doesn't print as those modules are not exposed for use.

### 🗺️ TPxi Geographic Distribution Map
This is a blue toolbar that visualizes the geographic spread of members or activities in google maps. It similar to Touchpoint's map tool, but has three advantages over Touchpoint. First, you can overlay demographic data from the census.  Second, you can click on the image to get info on the person similar to how James Kurtz is doing it, and Third, you can draw around a city, neighborhood, etc.. and tag and/or export to CSV those within that selection area.

### ⚡ TPxi Widget QuickLinks
Quick-access widgets for frequently used tools and dashboards.  These have permission, counts, and categories for displaying access links.
