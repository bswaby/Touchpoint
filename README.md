# Church Dashboard Suite

A collection of tools and dashboards designed to support church operations, communication, and data analysis for Touchpoint


## Overview

This repository is the work of one guy who loves Jesus, loves clean data, and loves seeing people come to Christ — so I built a bunch of tools to help make ministry smoother, simpler, and Spirit-led.

This is a bluetool bar that visualizes the geographic spread of members or activities.  There are two things this one has over Touchpoint's.  The first is that you can overlay demogaphic data from the census.  The second is that you can draw around a section of location and tag to the blue toolbar or export to csv.
