# üöÄ TouchPoint Integrated Tools (TPxi)

## üìã Overview

As a husband, father of two beautiful daughters, and dad to a special needs child, I've seen firsthand the importance of tools that truly serve people well. With experience in church leadership and a passion for development, I've built practical solutions to help ministries overcome everyday challenges.

I believe God calls us to build His Kingdom in every way we can‚Äîincluding through technology. These tools are designed to help your team work smarter, uncover meaningful insights, and focus more on what matters most: loving people and growing the Kingdom.
