A collection of tools and dashboards designed to support church operations, communication, and data analysis for Touchpoint


## Overview

This repository is the work of one guy who loves Jesus, loves clean data, and loves seeing people come to Christ ‚Äî so I built a bunch of tools to help make ministry smoother, more informed, reduce overhead, and help reach others.

## Finance

### [FortisFees](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/blob/main/Finance/FortisFees)
It breaks down fees by program and accounting code so accounting can use it to back charge. The biggest note is that the fees will be close to 99% but not 100% due to the disconnect of certain charges and reversals getting back to Touchpoint.  

### [QCD-GrantLetters](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/blob/main/Finance/QCD-GrantLetters)
Automatically create QCD and Grant letters that you can print out and add to each person's notes.
