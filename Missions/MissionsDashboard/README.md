### üåç [Missions Dashboard](https://github.com/bswaby/Touchpoint/tree/main/Missions/MissionsDashboard)
A comprehensive mission trip management dashboard that transformed how we coordinate, track, and report on global mission efforts. This tool consolidates trip planning, participant tracking, fundraising progress, and post-trip impact reporting into a unified interface. What used to require juggling multiple spreadsheets, email chains, and paper forms across different staff members is now centralized with real-time updates. 

Update: 20250615 Normalized the code to make it more adaptable for other churches.  
Note:  Touchpoint released some code in March that has <u>negatively</u> impacted one of the required tables that holds the funding.  While the tool still works, any funding is 8-10x slower loading now.  Support is aware and currently waiting on a resolution.
